# Neural Networks for Classification
This project is part of the homework assignment for the University of Padua's Computer Engineering MSc course. The notebook explores the use of Neural Networks for image classification, using a dataset of small images of clothes and accessories, the Fashion MNIST.

# Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 small grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, with 6,000 images per category. Each image is 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel has a value between 0 and 255. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
